            <li>This is also our first time to handle a Capture The Flag event.</li> 
            <li>In cryptography, a Caesar cipher, also known as Caesar's cipher, 
                the shift cipher, Caesar's code or Caesar shift, is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. 
                It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. 
                For example, with a left shift of 3, D would be replaced by A, E would become B, and so on. The method is named after Julius Caesar, who used it in his private correspondence.</li>
            <li>The Vigen√®re cipher is a method of encrypting alphabetic text by using a series of interwoven Caesar ciphers, based on the letters of a keyword. It employs a form of polyalphabetic substitution.</li>
